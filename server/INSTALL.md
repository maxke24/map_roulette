# Map Roulette — Server Install Guide

Map Roulette is an Android app that records rides and paints a "fog of war" of
the roads you have explored. It can talk to two self-hosted services:

| Service | What it does | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| **Sync server** | Accounts, trips, fog of war, badges, friends | Python 3.8+, ~50 MB. Nothing else. |
| **Routing server** | Generates curvy motorcycle round trips, car and bike routes | Docker, a multi-GB OSM download, 4–8 GB RAM during import |

You can install either or both. `install.sh` does the whole thing.

---

## Quick start

### On a Proxmox host

Run it as root on the **host**, not inside a container. It creates an
unprivileged LXC, sizes it for what you asked for, and installs inside it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maxke24/map_roulette.git
bash map_roulette/server/install.sh
```

It will ask what to install, then print an invite code and what to do next.
Non-interactive:

```bash
bash map_roulette/server/install.sh --all --yes --region europe/belgium
```

### On any Debian or Ubuntu machine

A VM, a Raspberry Pi, an existing LXC, bare metal — anything with systemd.
The same script detects it is not a Proxmox host and installs in place.

```bash
sudo bash map_roulette/server/install.sh --sync
```

Force this mode on a Proxmox host (installing directly onto the hypervisor,
which is usually a bad idea) with `--in-place`.

### Options

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--sync` / `--routing` / `--all` | What to install. Default: ask, or both with `--yes`. |
| `--region europe/belgium` | Geofabrik path, or a full `.osm.pbf` URL. |
| `--yes` | No prompts. |
| `--ctid 150` | Pick the container ID instead of the next free one. |
| `--storage local-lvm` `--bridge vmbr0` `--hostname maproulette` | Container placement. |
| `--open-registration` | Skip the invite code. Read the warning below first. |
| `--in-place` | Install here, never create a container. |
| `--uninstall` | Remove the services, keep the data. |
| `--purge` | Remove the services **and delete all data**. Asks first. |

## What you end up with

```
/opt/maproulette-sync/sync_server.py     the service (stdlib Python, no deps)
/var/lib/maproulette-sync/maproulette.db SQLite: accounts, trips, traces, badges
/var/backups/maproulette/                nightly backups, 14 days
/opt/graphhopper/                        docker-compose.yml, config.yml, OSM data

systemd: maproulette-sync.service        the sync API,   127.0.0.1:8790
         maproulette-backup.timer        nightly, 00:00 + jitter
         graphhopper-refresh.timer       monthly OSM refresh + re-import
         docker: graphhopper             the routing API, 127.0.0.1:8989
```

**Both services listen on localhost only.** The installer does not open a port,
touch your firewall, or configure a tunnel. Exposing them is your decision, and
the next section is about making it safely.

Re-running the installer is safe. It will not overwrite your database, and it
keeps the invite code it generated the first time.

---

## Exposing it to your phone

The app needs to reach the server from outside your LAN. Three ways, in the
order I would recommend them.

### 1. Cloudflare Tunnel + Access — no open ports

This is what the author runs. Cloudflare terminates TLS and refuses anything
without a valid service token, so neither service is ever reachable by a
stranger, and you open nothing on your router.

1. Install `cloudflared` on the same machine and create a tunnel
   (Zero Trust → Networks → Tunnels).
2. Add a public hostname per service, pointing at the local port:

   | Hostname | Service |
   |---|---|
   | `sync.example.com` | `http://localhost:8790` |
   | `routing.example.com` | `http://localhost:8989` |

3. Create a **service token** (Access → Service Auth).
4. Create an **Access application** for *each* hostname, with one policy:
   Action = **Service Auth**, include → that service token.
5. Check it from anywhere:

   ```bash
   # blocked without the token: expect 403, never 200
   curl -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://sync.example.com/health
   # allowed with it: expect 200
   curl -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://sync.example.com/health \
     -H "CF-Access-Client-Id: <id>" -H "CF-Access-Client-Secret: <secret>"
   ```

> **The routing server has no authentication of its own.** If you publish it
> without Access in front, you have published an open routing engine that
> anyone can use to burn your CPU. The sync server does authenticate users, but
> it should still sit behind Access.

If cloudflared runs in a *different* container than the services, `localhost`
will not resolve to them — use the LAN IP, and bind the services to it.

### 2. Tailscale or WireGuard

Put the phone and the server on the same private network and point the app at
the server's VPN address. Nothing is public at all. Simplest to reason about;
requires the VPN to be up on the phone.

### 3. Reverse proxy with TLS

Caddy or nginx with a real certificate. If you do this, keep registration
invite-gated, and put HTTP basic auth in front of the routing port.

---

## Two credentials, two different jobs

Do not confuse these. Both are involved when the app talks to the server.

| Credential | Issued by | Proves | Shared? |
|---|---|---|---|
| CF Access service token | Cloudflare | you may reach the hostname | **Yes** — the same one is in every copy of the APK |
| Bearer token | the sync server | **which user you are** | No — one per login |

The service token is a lock on the front door. Everyone who uses your server
holds the same key, so it is *not* identity. Identity is the bearer token, and
that is what decides whose trips come back from `/sync`.

### Registration and the invite code

The sync server would otherwise let anyone who reaches it create an account, so
the installer generates an invite code and prints it. Enter it in the app's
sign-in screen. It lives in
`/etc/systemd/system/maproulette-sync.service.d/invite.conf`.

Once everyone you care about has an account, close the door entirely:

```bash
echo 'Environment=REGISTRATION_OPEN=0' \
  >> /etc/systemd/system/maproulette-sync.service.d/invite.conf
systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart maproulette-sync
```

### The privacy rule

Friends can see each other's **totals and badges**. They can never see each
other's trips or traces. Exactly one endpoint returns another user's data
(`/friends/stats`), and it reads only the stats and badges columns.

The one exception is opt-in: `/friends/fog` returns a friend's fog-of-war
traces, but only when **both** people have turned sharing on. It is off by
default, reciprocal (stop sharing and you stop receiving), and revocable on the
next request. Trips are never returned to anyone but their owner, by any
endpoint.

---

## Configure the app

In the app: **Settings → Server**.

```
Sync URL      https://sync.example.com
Routing URL   https://routing.example.com
CF Access ID / Secret     (only for option 1 above)
Invite code               (on the sign-in screen, first time only)
```

Then sign in. The app refuses to sync until you do — an un-upgraded phone
silently stops syncing rather than erroring.

---

## Verify

```bash
bash server/verify.sh                       # sync only
INVITE=<code> bash server/verify.sh --routing   # both
```

It creates three throwaway accounts, exercises isolation between users, the
friends privacy guarantee, fog-sharing in both directions, idempotent merging
and the brute-force lockout, then deletes the accounts. `ALL PASS` is the only
acceptable result.

The installer copies it to `/usr/local/bin/maproulette-verify.sh`.

---

## Choosing an OSM region

`--region` takes a [Geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/) path such as
`europe/belgium`, `europe/netherlands`, `north-america/us/colorado`, or a full
URL to any `.osm.pbf`.

| Extract | Download | RAM for import | Import time |
|---|---|---|---|
| `europe/andorra` | 3 MB | 2 GB | seconds |
| `europe/belgium` | 500 MB | 4 GB | ~10 min |
| `europe/benelux` | 1.5 GB | 6 GB | ~20 min |
| a whole large country | 3 GB+ | 8 GB+ | 40 min+ |

The installer sizes the Java heap at ~70% of available RAM and gives an LXC
8 GB by default. Bigger regions need more; routing quality does not improve
with a bigger extract, so take the smallest one that covers where you ride.

To change region later, re-run with a new `--region`, or edit
`datareader.file` in `/opt/graphhopper/data/config.yml` and delete the graph
(below).

---

## Maintenance

**Backups.** Nightly, automatic, 14 days, in `/var/backups/maproulette`. They
use SQLite's backup API, not `cp` — a plain copy of a live WAL database can be
torn — and each one is checked with `PRAGMA integrity_check`. Run one now:

```bash
/usr/local/bin/maproulette-backup.sh
```

To restore, stop the service and put the file back:

```bash
systemctl stop maproulette-sync
cp /var/backups/maproulette/maproulette-2026-07-10.db \
   /var/lib/maproulette-sync/maproulette.db
rm -f /var/lib/maproulette-sync/maproulette.db-wal \
      /var/lib/maproulette-sync/maproulette.db-shm
chown maproulette-sync: /var/lib/maproulette-sync/maproulette.db
systemctl start maproulette-sync
```

If the server lives in an LXC, the container-local backup dies with the
container. Add it to your hypervisor's backup job as well.

**OSM refresh.** `graphhopper-refresh.timer` re-downloads the extract monthly
and re-imports. Routing is down for the duration of the import. Force it now:

```bash
systemctl start graphhopper-refresh.service
journalctl -u graphhopper-refresh -f
```

**Forcing a re-import** (after editing profiles or encoded values):

```bash
cd /opt/graphhopper
docker compose down
rm -rf data/graph-cache        # the graph, not the .pbf
docker compose up -d && docker compose logs -f
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**GraphHopper never becomes ready / the container keeps restarting.**
Almost always the import ran out of memory. Raise the heap in
`/opt/graphhopper/docker-compose.yml` (`JAVA_OPTS: "-Xmx8g -Xms1g"`), give the
LXC more RAM, or use a smaller extract. `docker compose logs --tail 50` will
show the `OutOfMemoryError`.

**My config changes to `graph.location` do nothing.**
They do something, but not what you would expect. The image's entrypoint always
appends `-Ddw.graphhopper.graph.location=<--graph-cache value>`, defaulting to
`/data/default-gh`, and a Dropwizard `-Ddw.` property can only *override a key
that already exists* in the YAML. So:

- key present in `config.yml` → the flag wins, YAML value ignored;
- key absent → the flag is silently dropped, and the graph lands in
  `/data/<extract-name>-gh`.

The installer keeps `graph.location: /data/graph-cache` in the YAML *and*
passes `--graph-cache /data/graph-cache` in `command:`. Keep them in sync, or
you will delete a directory that is not the one being used and wonder why your
re-import silently reused the old graph.

**`curl … | bash` fails with 404.** The repository is private, or the branch
does not exist. Clone it and run the script from the checkout — it copies the
files it needs directly and never touches the network for them.

**Docker will not start inside the LXC.** It needs `nesting=1,keyctl=1`. The
installer sets both when it creates the container; if you made the container
yourself, add them (`pct set <id> --features nesting=1,keyctl=1`) and reboot it.

**`POST /auth/register` returns 429.** Ten failed auth attempts from one IP in
five minutes locks that IP out. A wrong invite code counts as a failure.
Successful logins never consume the budget. Wait five minutes, or restart the
service to clear the in-memory counter.

**The app syncs nothing and reports no error.** It refuses to sync until you
sign in. Check Settings → Server.

---

## Migrating from the old single-user server

Earlier versions stored `trips.json` and `traces.jsonl` with no accounts. To
adopt that data, register your account, then attribute the files to it:

```bash
systemctl stop maproulette-sync
sudo -u maproulette-sync DATA_DIR=/var/lib/maproulette-sync \
  python3 /opt/maproulette-sync/sync_server.py --import-legacy <username>
systemctl start maproulette-sync
```

It uses `INSERT OR IGNORE`, so running it twice is harmless, and it leaves the
old files where they are. Delete them once the app has synced successfully.

---

## API reference

Everything except `/health` and `/auth/*` needs `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
Errors are `{"error": "..."}` with a real status code, and the app shows that
string to the user verbatim — so keep any you add plain.

| Method | Path | Body | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | — | `ok` |
| POST | `/auth/register` | `{username, password, invite?}` | `{token, username}` |
| POST | `/auth/login` | `{username, password}` | `{token, username}` |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | — | `{}` |
| GET | `/me` | — | `{username, stats, badges}` |
| POST | `/sync` | `{trips, traces, badges, stats, shareFog?}` | merged `{trips, traces, badges}` |
| GET | `/friends` | — | `{friends, incoming, outgoing}` |
| POST | `/friends/request` | `{username}` | `{status}` |
| POST | `/friends/respond` | `{username, accept}` | `{status}` |
| POST | `/friends/remove` | `{username}` | `{}` |
| GET | `/friends/stats` | — | `[{username, stats, badges}]` |
| GET | `/friends/fog` | — | `{sharing, traces}` |

Merging is idempotent. Trips deduplicate on `(user, startTimeMs)`, traces on
`(user, sha256(line))`, badges keep the **earliest** earned date so a reinstall
cannot push it forward. `stats` and `shareFog` are only touched when the key is
present, so an older client cannot blank a user's stats or silently change
their sharing.

Passwords are PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, 210,000 rounds, per-user salt. Tokens are 32
random bytes stored only as a SHA-256 hash, so a database leak hands over no
live sessions. There is no password reset (there is no mail server) and no
token expiry — delete the row, or `/auth/logout`.
